"Grupo 1 - ES27 Impacta" is a collaborative project aimed at promoting literacy in public transportation through the 'Leitura no Vag√£o' initiative. Our project encourages commuters to donate and locate books via a dedicated mobile application. Join our community to contribute or discover books, enhancing the reading culture on the go.

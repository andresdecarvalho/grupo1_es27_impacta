# Leitura no Vagão - Grupo 1

"Leitura no Vagão" is a community-driven initiative aimed at promoting literacy in public transportation. Our project encourages commuters to donate and locate books via a dedicated mobile application.

## Project Overview

In Brazil, many people spend significant time commuting via public transport daily, yet access to books during these journeys is limited. Our project addresses this challenge by facilitating book donations and tracking their geographical location using a mobile app.

## Key Features

- **Book Donation**: Commuters can donate books at designated collection points within transport vehicles.
- **Book Location**: Users can use the app to locate available books nearby and track their circulation.
- **Community Engagement**: Build a community of readers who share and promote the culture of reading on the go.

## How It Works

1. **Donate Books**: Place your books in designated collection points inside the vehicles.
2. **Find Books**: Use the app to locate books available near you.
3. **Read and Share**: Take a book, read it, and leave it in another vehicle for others to enjoy.

## App Features

- **User Registration**: Join as a reader, supporter, or book donor.
- **Interactive Map**: Track book locations and circulation history.
- **Reading History**: Keep track of your reading and donation activities.

## Benefits

- **Free Access to Books**: Provides free access to reading materials for commuters.
- **Promotes Literacy**: Encourages reading habits during daily commutes.
- **Community Building**: Fosters a community of readers passionate about sharing knowledge.

## Get Involved

Join our community of readers, donate books, use the app to find new titles, and share this initiative with friends and family.
